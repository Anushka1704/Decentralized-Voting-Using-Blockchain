# Decentralized-Voting-Using-Blockchain
This is a Python-based Django project to simulate a concept of blockchain-based e-voting protocol. The simulation comprises two sections: "Block" and "Chain". Block: a potential voter has to successfully registering using credentials and the public key. Via the ballot page, the voter gives his pseudonym (UUID 4) and candidate number. If the submitted ballot is proven to be valid, it will be sealed (mined).You can examine the whole process in detail using the console. Chain: Transactions (ballots) with valid data will be generated. They are then sealed into blocks. After that, you can explore the transactions and blocks, try to tamper the records, and verify them.
